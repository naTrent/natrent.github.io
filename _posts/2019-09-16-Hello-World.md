_This is my first blog post. Mostly created to test if all things here on Github Pages with Jekyll theme works correctly._

### Welcome you in the Test Cube blog. 

You may wondering what is this place and for what I've created it?

It is simple - I need a place where I can store whole my thoughts, discovers and lessons learned. I am working as a QA more than 7 years. As a tester even more. 

First as a mobile tester when Android system event wasn't there yet on the market, and Nokia was the company that set trends. 

Then I moved to another domain and discover whole world of Quality Assurance. I am still here trying to find my best way to learn and master technologies that changes our world day by day.

Already know that it is endless quest. But during that journey I discover not a goal itself is important here but continuous progress in development, gathering skills and companions met on the trail.

As you probably noticed already I wrote a lot (not necessarily sticking to the topic). That is because deep inside I am humanist who is fascinated by technology. What in my opinion, changes everything!

That said please be prepared the knowledge you find here now and in the future will be addressed to people like me.

That means sometimes I will write here some obvious things. By writing 'obvious' I mean it clearly like OBVIOUS. So please be gently judging my work.

I hope that my style of writing and explaining technical subjects (also related and connected with soft skills and people) will suits your needs and you find somehow helpful here.

Lets get started then!

###### P.S. 
I am not a native english speaker. I make mistakes - we all do tho! Trying the best to keep my text simple, clear and correct as my knowledge allows me to do.
If you find some typos or grammar issues and want to teach me how I can write it differently - feel free to send me a constructive feedback.
